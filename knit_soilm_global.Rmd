## Aggregate site data

Aggregate FLUXNET 2015 site scale data to single data frame, using all sites. Aggregation is done for daily data using P-model output and observational data, and for 8-day periods using MTE and MODIS data, combined with observational data (mean over 8-day period):
```{r aggregate_all, eval=FALSE}
source("aggregate_all_fluxnet2015.R")
```

Do the same as above but now only for a subset of sites where the NN-FLUXNET2015 method performed well. This data includes the NN-predicted values. 
```{r aggregate_nn, eval=FALSE}
source("aggregate_nn_fluxnet2015.R")
```

## Correct GPP
Apply the empirical correction function for GPP. The following steps are required:

1. Define relationship between fLUE_0 and annual mean AET/PET
```{r flue_0, eval=FALSE}
source("xxx.R")
```

2. Define correction function (function of soil moisture) for each site
```{r correctionfunction, eval=FALSE}
source("xxx.R")
```

3. Apply function to estimate fLUE
```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("xxx.R")
```

4. Calculate corrected GPP
```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("xxx.R")
```

## Align data by drought events (dbt whether necessary -> check ratio vs. fLUE plot)

## Plot bias versus dryness

## in R, plot IAV (distribution across gridcells) of P-model before and after soil moisture correction, MODIS GPP, MTE GPP, TRENDY models
## in R/cdo: plot average relative IAV increase due to soil moisture effect as a function of spatial scale (as in Jung)
## in R Ahlstroem plot

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

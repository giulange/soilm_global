  abstract = "Abstract Latest climate projections suggest that both frequency
              and intensity of climate extremes will be substantially modified
              over the course of the coming decades. As a consequence, we need
              to understand to what extent and via which pathways climate
              extremes affect the state and functionality of terrestrial
              ecosystems and the associated biogeochemical cycles on a global
              scale. So far the impacts of climate extremes on the terrestrial
              biosphere were mainly investigated on the basis of case studies,
              while global assessments are widely lacking. In order to
              facilitate global analysis of this kind, we present a
              methodological framework that firstly detects spatiotemporally
              contiguous extremes in Earth observations, and secondly infers
              the likely pathway of the preceding climate anomaly. The approach
              does not require long time series, is computationally fast, and
              easily applicable to a variety of data sets with different
              spatial and temporal resolutions. The key element of our analysis
              strategy is to directly search in the relevant observations for
              spatiotemporally connected components exceeding a certain
              percentile threshold. We also put an emphasis on characterization
              of extreme event distribution, and scrutinize the attribution
              issue. We exemplify the analysis strategy by exploring the
              fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR)
              from 1982 to 2011. Our results suggest that the hot spots of
              extremes in fAPAR lie in Northeastern Brazil, Southeastern
              Australia, Kenya and Tanzania. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
              size distribution of extremes follow a distinct power law. The
              attribution framework reveals that extremes in fAPAR are
              primarily driven by phases of water scarcity.",

              basis for life on land. Earth System Models (ESMs) incorporating
              the interactions of land ecosystems and climate are used to
              predict the future of the terrestrial sink for anthropogenic CO .
              ESMs require accurate representation of GPP. However, current
              ESMs disagree on how GPP responds to environmental variations ,
              suggesting a need for a more robust theoretical framework for
              modelling . Here, we focus on a key quantity for GPP, the ratio
              of leaf internal to external CO ($\chi$). $\chi$ is tightly
              regulated and depends on environmental conditions, but is
              represented empirically and incompletely in today's models. We
              show that a simple evolutionary optimality hypothesis predicts
              specific quantitative dependencies of $\chi$ on temperature,
              vapour pressure deficit and elevation; and that these same
              dependencies emerge from an independent analysis of empirical
              $\chi$ values, derived from a worldwide dataset of >3,500 leaf
              stable carbon isotope measurements. A single global equation
              embodying these relationships then unifies the empirical
              light-use efficiency model with the standard model of C
              photosynthesis , and successfully predicts GPP measured at
              eddy-covariance flux sites. This success is notable given the
              equation's simplicity and broad applicability across biomes and
              plant functional types. It provides a theoretical underpinning
              for the analysis of plant functional coordination across species
              and emergent properties of ecosystems, and a potential basis for
              the reformulation of the controls of GPP in next-generation ESMs.",

              responses can be efficiently modelled without recourse to
              empirical models or underlying mechanism. Previous efforts have
              been challenged by the lack of a transparent index for the cost
              of losing water. Yet it is accepted that stomata control water
              loss to avoid excessive loss of hydraulic conductance from
              cavitation and soil drying. Proximity to hydraulic failure and
              desiccation can represent the cost of water loss. If at any given
              instant, the stomatal aperture adjusts to maximize the
              instantaneous difference between photosynthetic gain and
              hydraulic cost, then a model can predict the trajectory of
              stomatal responses to changes in environment across time. Results
              of this optimization model are consistent with the widely used
              Ball-Berry-Leuning empirical model (r > 0.99) across a wide range
              of vapour pressure deficits and ambient CO concentrations for wet
              soil. The advantage of the optimization approach is the absence
              of empirical coefficients, applicability to dry as well as wet
              soil and prediction of plant hydraulic status along with gas
              exchange.",

              twentieth-century trends in drought regimes are ambiguous, across
              many regions more frequent and severe droughts are expected in
              the twenty-first century. Recovery time-how long an ecosystem

  abstract = "Monitoring, understanding and modelling carbon emission and

              stakeholders in the application of mitigation strategies. In this
              study, we use the remote sensing model C-Fix at the local stand
              scale to improve the integration of algorithms for water and
              temperature limitation. These new algorithms are applied to
              estimate net ecosystem productivity in a fully water limited
              mode. Four different C-Fix scenarios (partially and fully water
              limited, partially and fully water limited with temperature
              conversion), to obtain net ecosystem productivity of European
              forests, were compared with \{EUROFLUX\} measurements using
              different statistics. In the first scenario (i) C-Fix is
              partially water limited since the \{NDVI\} is used as indicator
              for the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation
              (fAPAR). The \{NDVI\} depends on plant water availability at the
              long term (months). In the fully water limited C-Fix scenario
              (ii) short-term water availability is included taking into
              account soil moisture content. The third (iii) and fourth (iv)
              scenarios are respectively the partially and fully water limited
              scenarios wherein canopy and soil temperature, derived from the
              atmospheric temperature, are incorporated to account for the
              temperature driven processes of vegetation and soil. The error
              propagation by C-Fix was also analysed. Introducing water
              limitation and converting atmospheric temperature to apparent
              canopy and soil temperatures, significantly improves validation
              results based on \{EUROFLUX\} data. For pooled data, a final
              slope, intercept and correlation coefficient of the linear
              regression between C-Fix and \{EUROFLUX\} \{NEP\} values is 0.86,
              0.09 and 0.64, respectively. When implementing full water
              limitation a reduction of 42\% of the estimated \{NEP\} is
              obtained with respect to partially limited NEP. The error
              propagation by C-Fix for the partially and fully water limited

              based model with potential in regional, continental and global
              dry matter estimations and in carbon uptake/release studies,

              understanding for reliably predicting photosynthetic capacity is
              still missing. To advance this understanding we have tested
              across C(3) plant species the coordination hypothesis, which
              assumes nitrogen allocation to photosynthetic processes such that
              photosynthesis tends to be co-limited by
              ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation and regeneration.
              The coordination hypothesis yields an analytical solution to
              predict photosynthetic capacity and calculate area-based leaf
              nitrogen content (N(a)). The resulting model linking leaf
              photosynthesis, stomata conductance and nitrogen investment
              provides testable hypotheses about the physiological regulation
              of these processes. Based on a dataset of 293 observations for 31
              species grown under a range of environmental conditions, we
              confirm the coordination hypothesis: under mean environmental
              conditions experienced by leaves during the preceding month, RuBP
              carboxylation equals RuBP regeneration. We identify three key
              parameters for photosynthetic coordination: specific leaf area
              and two photosynthetic traits (k(3), which modulates N investment
              and is the ratio of RuBP carboxylation/oxygenation capacity
              (V(Cmax)) to leaf photosynthetic N content (N(pa)); and J(fac),
              which modulates photosynthesis for a given k(3) and is the ratio
              of RuBP regeneration capacity (J(max)) to V(Cmax)). With
              species-specific parameter values of SLA, k(3) and J(fac), our
              leaf photosynthesis coordination model accounts for 93\% of the
              total variance in N(a) across species and environmental
              conditions. A calibration by plant functional type of k(3) and
              J(fac) still leads to accurate model prediction of N(a), while
              SLA calibration is essentially required at species level.
              Observed variations in k(3) and J(fac) are partly explained by
              environmental and phylogenetic constraints, while SLA variation
              is partly explained by phylogeny. These results open a new avenue

              predictions for a selection of soil properties (at six standard
              depths): soil organic carbon (g kg-1), soil pH, sand, silt and
              clay fractions (\%), bulk density (kg m-3), cation-exchange
              capacity (cmol+/kg), coarse fragments (\%), soil organic carbon
              stock (t ha-1), depth to bedrock (cm), World Reference Base soil
              groups, and USDA Soil Taxonomy suborders. Our predictions are
              based on global spatial prediction models which we fitted, per
              soil variable, using a compilation of major international soil
              profile databases (ca. 110,000 soil profiles), and a selection of
              ca. 75 global environmental covariates representing soil forming
              factors. Results of regression modeling indicate that the most
              useful covariates for modeling soils at the global scale are
              climatic and biomass indices (based on MODIS images), lithology,
              and taxonomic mapping units derived from conventional soil survey
              (Harmonized World Soil Database). Prediction accuracies assessed
              using 5-fold cross-validation were between 23-51\%.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SoilGrids1km provide an initial set of
              examples of soil spatial data for input into global models at a
              resolution and consistency not previously available. Some of the
              main limitations of the current version of SoilGrids1km are: (1)
              weak relationships between soil properties/classes and
              explanatory variables due to scale mismatches, (2) difficulty to
              obtain covariates that capture soil forming factors, (3) low
              sampling density and spatial clustering of soil profile
              locations. However, as the SoilGrids system is highly automated
              and flexible, increasingly accurate predictions can be generated
              as new input data become available. SoilGrids1km are available
